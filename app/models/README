Add your ActiveRecord models here.

You can create them by being in the application root directory and running, e.g.,

rake generate:model NAME=User


if using a user.rb model, make sure to include:

  include BCrypt
  has_secure_password

this will allow bcrypt to encrypt the password as it comes in from a form
